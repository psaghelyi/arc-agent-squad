# ARC Agents - GRC Agent Squad Project

## Project Overview
This project implements an AI agent squad specifically designed for the **Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance (GRC)** industry. The system provides intelligent, voice-enabled agents that assist with compliance assessments, risk management, audit interviews, and regulatory guidance.

### Business Context
- **Industry Focus**: Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance (GRC)
- **Primary Use Cases**: 
  - Compliance requirement analysis and mapping
  - Risk assessment and mitigation guidance
  - Audit interview automation and documentation
  - Regulatory change impact analysis
  - Control effectiveness evaluation

## Architecture & Technology Stack

### Core Framework
- **Agent Orchestration**: [AWS Labs agent-squad](mdc:https:/github.com/awslabs/agent-squad) framework
- **LLM Platform**: Amazon Bedrock with Claude models (default: us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0)
- **Infrastructure**: AWS CDK with ECS Fargate deployment

### Voice & Conversation Services
- **Speech-to-Text**: [Amazon Transcribe Streaming](mdc:https:/aws.amazon.com/transcribe) for real-time voice input
- **Natural Language Understanding**: [Amazon Lex V2](mdc:https:/aws.amazon.com/lex) for dialog management
- **Text-to-Speech**: [Amazon Polly Neural TTS](mdc:https:/docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/neural-voices.html) for natural voice output
- **Real-time Audio**: Amazon Lex V2 via agent-squad.LexBotAgent for voice interactions

### Supporting Services
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Amazon Step Functions (triggered by Bedrock Agents)
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch Logs and Metrics
- **Container Registry**: Amazon ECR
- **Load Balancing**: Application Load Balancer (ALB)

## Agent System Requirements

### Agent Personalities & Roles

1. **Information Collector Agent** (`empathetic_interviewer`)
   - **Personality**: Talkative, kind, patient, encouraging
   - **Primary Role**: Conduct interviews, gather detailed information
   - **Use Cases**: Audit interviews, stakeholder consultations, requirement gathering
   - **Voice Capability**: Essential for natural interview flow

2. **Official Compliance Agent** (`authoritative_compliance`)
   - **Personality**: Official, formal, to-the-point, regulation-focused
   - **Primary Role**: Provide definitive compliance guidance and interpretations
   - **Use Cases**: Regulatory interpretation, compliance status reporting, formal documentation
   - **Voice Capability**: Professional announcements, formal briefings

3. **Risk Expert Agent** (`analytical_risk_expert`)
   - **Personality**: Analytical, detail-oriented, systematic, thorough
   - **Primary Role**: Risk assessment, analysis, and mitigation strategies
   - **Use Cases**: Risk modeling, control gap analysis, threat assessment
   - **Voice Capability**: Technical explanations, risk briefings

4. **Governance Specialist Agent** (`strategic_governance`)
   - **Personality**: Strategic, consultative, big-picture focused, diplomatic
   - **Primary Role**: Governance framework guidance and strategic recommendations
   - **Use Cases**: Policy development, governance structure design, board reporting
   - **Voice Capability**: Executive briefings, strategic discussions

### Super Agent (Orchestrator)
- **Role**: Single point of contact for all user interactions
- **Functionality**: 
  - Analyze incoming requests and route to appropriate specialist agent
  - Coordinate multi-agent workflows when complex tasks require multiple perspectives
  - Maintain conversation context across agent handoffs
  - Aggregate responses from multiple agents when needed

## Tool Integration Requirements

### Mandatory Tool Categories

1. **MCP (Model Context Protocol) Tools**
   - File system operations for document analysis
   - Database querying for compliance records
   - Custom business logic integration

2. **Diligent API Integration**
   - Board meeting management
   - Document repository access
   - Governance workflow integration
   - Compliance tracking and reporting

3. **External API Tools**
   - Regulatory database APIs (e.g., SEC EDGAR, GDPR guidance)
   - Legal research APIs
   - Industry benchmark APIs
   - Third-party risk assessment tools

4. **Search & Analysis Tools**
   - Document search across compliance repositories
   - Regulatory change monitoring
   - Best practice research
   - Competitor analysis tools

### Tool Usage Patterns
- **Information Collector**: Primarily uses search and document analysis tools
- **Official Compliance**: Focuses on regulatory APIs and compliance databases
- **Risk Expert**: Utilizes risk assessment APIs and analytical tools
- **Governance Specialist**: Leverages board management and strategic planning tools

## Development & Deployment Guidelines

### Authentication & Access
- **AWS Authentication**: For local development, use `aws-vault exec acl-playground --` for secure credential management because I have federated SSO.
- **Target Environment**: `acl-playground` account in `us-west-2` region
- **Local Development**: Support for local testing with AWS service mocking where possible

### Build & Deployment System
- **Build System**: Makefile with standardized targets:
  - `make install` - Environment setup and dependency installation
  - `make build` - Container image building
  - `make push` - Push to ECR registry
  - `make local-start` - Local development environment
  - `make test` - Runs tests
  - `make cdk-deploy` - Infrastructure deployment
  - `make deploy` - Application deployment to ECS

### Infrastructure Requirements
- **Container Orchestration**: ECS Fargate for scalable, serverless containers
- **Networking**: VPC with private subnets for secure AWS service communication
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch integration for logs, metrics, and alerting

## Voice Interview Capabilities

### Core Voice Features
- **Real-time Transcription**: Stream audio to Amazon Transcribe for live text conversion
- **Intelligent Response**: Process transcribed text through appropriate GRC agent
- **Natural Speech Output**: Convert agent responses to speech via Amazon Polly Neural TTS
- **Conversation Flow**: Maintain interview context and follow-up question logic

### Interview Types Supported
1. **Compliance Audit Interviews**: Structured questioning about control implementation
2. **Risk Assessment Interviews**: Exploratory discussions about risk factors and mitigation
