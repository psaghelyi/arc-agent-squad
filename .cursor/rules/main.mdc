I want to create a Python project. 
I have pyenv installed, please create a virtualenv for the project from 3.13.2.
I would like to implement an agent swarm with @https://github.com/awslabs/agent-squad .
I want to host my agents in AWS cloude.
I want to use Bedrock models with voice support and memory.
I want to use `aws-vault` for CDK deploy and local test. The preferred account is `acl-playground` in `us-west-2`.
I also need Makefile to build, push and local start.

Probably we need:
- Amazon Transcribe
- Amazon Lex
- Amazon Bedrock Agent (may start Step Functions workflow)
- Amazon Polly (NTTS)
- WebRTC (for audio input and output, but I am not sure on this)
