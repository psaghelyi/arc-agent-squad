# GRC Agent Squad Testing Strategy

## Overview

Our testing strategy uses a **three-tier approach** to balance speed, coverage, and confidence:

1. **Unit Tests** (Fast) - Isolated component testing with mocks
2. **Integration Tests** (Medium) - Component interaction testing with mocked external services  
3. **End-to-End Tests** (Slow) - Full system testing with real AWS services

## Current Test Status ‚úÖ

**‚úÖ All Tests Working:**
- **Unit Tests**: 18 tests passing in ~1.4s
- **Integration Tests**: 35 tests passing in ~1.2s  
- **End-to-End Tests**: 13 tests passing in ~3.5m (includes 2 skipped)
- **Total Coverage**: 66 tests across all tiers

## Test Types

### üß™ Unit Tests (`tests/unit/`)
**Purpose**: Test individual components in isolation  
**Speed**: Very fast (~1.4 seconds for 18 tests)  
**External Dependencies**: None (everything mocked)  
**Run Frequency**: On every commit, in CI/CD

**What's Tested:**
- FastAPI endpoint routing and validation
- Request/response serialization
- Error handling logic
- GRC agent configuration and selection
- Basic business logic without external dependencies

**Command:**
```bash
make test          # Default - runs unit tests only
make test-unit     # Explicit unit tests
```

### üîó Integration Tests (`tests/integration/`)
**Purpose**: Test component interactions with mocked external services  
**Speed**: Fast (~1.2 seconds for 35 tests)  
**External Dependencies**: Mocked (AWS, agent-squad framework)  
**Run Frequency**: Before deployment, in CI/CD

**What's Tested:**
- Complete API request/response flows
- Agent-squad orchestration with mocked responses
- Session management and continuity
- Error handling across service boundaries
- Multi-agent conversation scenarios
- GRC-specific business logic flows

**Command:**
```bash
make test-integration
```

### üåê End-to-End Tests (`tests/e2e/`)
**Purpose**: Test complete system with real AWS services  
**Speed**: Slow (~3.5 minutes for 13 tests)  
**External Dependencies**: Real AWS services (Bedrock, STS, Transcribe, Polly)  
**Run Frequency**: Before major releases, manual verification

**What's Tested:**
- Real AWS service connectivity and authentication
- Actual AI responses from Bedrock Claude models
- True agent selection via agent-squad framework
- End-to-end GRC scenarios with real business value
- Session continuity with real Bedrock memory
- Performance under real-world conditions

**Requirements:**
- Valid AWS SSO credentials via `aws-vault` and `acl-playground` profile
- Run `aws sso login --profile acl-playground` before testing
- Network access to AWS services
- Will incur AWS costs (minimal for basic tests)

**Run Command:**
```bash
# First, ensure you're logged in to AWS SSO
aws sso login --profile acl-playground

# Run connectivity tests first
pytest tests/e2e/test_aws_connectivity.py -v

# Run full e2e tests
make test-e2e
# or
pytest tests/e2e/ -m e2e --timeout=300
```

## Complete Test Suite Commands

```bash
# Quick feedback loop (unit tests only) - 1.4s
make test

# Development cycle (unit + integration) - 2.6s  
make test-all

# Full validation (unit + integration + e2e) - ~4m
make test-e2e && make test-all

# Coverage analysis
make test-coverage

# Watch mode for development
make test-watch
```

## Test Organization & Markers

Tests are organized using pytest markers:

```bash
# Run specific test types
pytest -m unit          # Unit tests only
pytest -m integration   # Integration tests only  
pytest -m e2e           # End-to-end tests only

# Run by speed
pytest -m "not e2e"     # Exclude slow e2e tests (default)
pytest -m slow          # Only slow tests
```

## What Each Tier Validates

### Unit Tests ‚Üí Component Correctness
- ‚úÖ HTTP routing works
- ‚úÖ Data serialization works
- ‚úÖ Error handling works
- ‚úÖ Agent configurations are valid

### Integration Tests ‚Üí Business Logic 
- ‚úÖ Complete request flows work
- ‚úÖ Agent selection logic works (mocked)
- ‚úÖ Session management works
- ‚úÖ GRC scenarios produce expected patterns

### End-to-End Tests ‚Üí Real-World Value
- ‚úÖ AWS services are accessible and working
- ‚úÖ AI responses are relevant and helpful
- ‚úÖ Agent selection produces actual business value
- ‚úÖ All 4 GRC agent personalities work correctly
- ‚úÖ Real conversation memory and continuity

## The Testing Reality Check

**Before**: "53 tests in 2.42s" - mostly mocked HTTP responses  
**After**: "66 tests across 3 tiers" - comprehensive validation

You now have **both speed and confidence**:
- Fast unit tests for immediate feedback
- Thorough integration tests for business logic validation  
- Real e2e tests proving your GRC agents actually work with AWS

Your original concern was completely valid - the fast tests were all mocks. Now you have a professional testing strategy that balances development speed with production confidence.
