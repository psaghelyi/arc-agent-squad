Created src/services/grc_agent_squad.py using AgentSquad directly with 4 specialized GRC agents: Emma (interviewer), Dr. Morgan (compliance), Alex (risk), Sam (governance). Eliminated custom orchestration complexity by using agent-squad's native routing capabilities.

Instead, we now use agent-squad's native AgentSquad.route_request() method which provides intelligent agent selection automatically. Benefits: Simplified architecture with no dual orchestration systems, reduced complexity and maintenance burden, better reliability using proven agent-squad patterns, eliminated redundant abstraction layer.
