# Overview  
ARC Agents is a voice-enabled AI agent squad specifically designed for the Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance (GRC) industry. The system provides intelligent agents with distinct personalities that assist with compliance assessments, risk management, audit interviews, and regulatory guidance. The solution leverages AWS services including Bedrock, Transcribe, Polly, and Lex to deliver real-time voice interactions and sophisticated agent orchestration using the AWS Labs agent-squad framework.

The primary problem this solves is the complexity and time-intensive nature of GRC processes, particularly audit interviews, compliance assessments, and risk evaluations. By providing specialized AI agents with voice capabilities, organizations can streamline these processes while maintaining high quality and consistency.
