# Overview  
ARC Agents is a voice-enabled AI agent squad specifically designed for the Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance (GRC) industry. The system provides intelligent agents with distinct personalities that assist with compliance assessments, risk management, audit interviews, and regulatory guidance. The solution leverages AWS services including Bedrock, Transcribe, Polly, and Lex to deliver real-time voice interactions and sophisticated agent orchestration.

The primary problem this solves is the complexity and time-intensive nature of GRC processes, particularly audit interviews, compliance assessments, and risk evaluations. By providing specialized AI agents with voice capabilities, organizations can streamline these processes while maintaining high quality and consistency.

# Core Features

## Key User Flows
1. **Voice Interview Flow**: User initiates voice session → Super Agent analyzes request → Routes to appropriate specialist agent → Conducts structured interview → Provides summary and recommendations
2. **Compliance Query Flow**: User asks regulatory question → Official Compliance Agent provides authoritative guidance with regulatory references
3. **Risk Assessment Flow**: User describes risk scenario → Risk Expert Agent analyzes and provides mitigation strategies
4. **Multi-Agent Consultation**: Complex scenarios requiring multiple agent perspectives with coordinated responses

## UI/UX Considerations
- Clean, professional web interface suitable for enterprise environments
- Voice-first design with visual feedback for transcription accuracy
- Real-time conversation display with agent identification
- Document upload capabilities for context-aware analysis
- Mobile-responsive design for field audit interviews
